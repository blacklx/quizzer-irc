# Environment Variables for Quizzer IRC Bot
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# .env is in .gitignore and will not be committed to git

# NickServ Password (required if using NickServ authentication)
# Format: NICKSERV_PASSWORD=your_password_here
NICKSERV_PASSWORD=your_nickserv_password_here

# Admin Passwords (required if using password-based admin verification)
# Format: ADMIN_PASSWORD_<nickname>=password
# These passwords will be auto-hashed on first use
# Example:
# ADMIN_PASSWORD_YourNick=your_secure_password_123
# ADMIN_PASSWORD_AdminNick2=another_secure_password_456

# Note: After first use, passwords are hashed and stored in admin_passwords.yaml
# The plaintext in .env can be removed for security, but keeping it allows
# the bot to re-hash if needed (e.g., after password changes)
